                        MapStudy is an integrated, modularized framework for the creation of survey applications designed to test cartographic design and interaction hypotheses in a modern web map environment. It leverages Postgresql and PHP on the server side and Javascript, jQuery, and Leaflet on the client. MapStudy is being developed specifically for use in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Cartography program through the support of the UW-Madison Cartography Lab and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

                    <h2><a href="https://github.com/uwcartlab/webmapping">Web Mapping Workbook</a></h2>
                        <p>This workbook introduces the practical skills needed to develop interactive maps and visualizations on the open web. Compared to a traditional textbook, this workbook utilizes a "spiral" curriculum of short but interconnected lessons that incrementally build proficiency in interactive cartography and visualization.  </p>
                        <p>The technological landscape for web mapping and visualization is broad, and this workbook is intended as a partial entry point rather than a comprehensive survey. Specifically, the workbook covers core open source web technologies, including the HTML, CSS, and (in particular) JavaScript languages and the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a> and <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> web mapping and visualization libraries. Throughout, Github is used as the primary teaching and learning platform. This workbook is free to use, share, and extend as an open educational resource following a CC-BY license.</p>
                        <p>The workbook is funded by <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1555267">NSF CAREER #1555267</a> and is meant to be a living resource updated by the <a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/cartography/">University of Wisconsin Cartography Lab</a>. Version 1.0 was released on October 12, 2021. However, the workbook is constantly being updated on GitHub as we actively teach with it during the semester.</p>

The book teaches principles of cartography through the United Nationsâ€™ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Mapping for a Sustainable World was developed as a collaboration between the United Nations and the International Cartographic Association with the University of Wisconsin Cartography Lab supporting creation of the book layout and all maps and graphics through <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1555267">National Science Foundation CAREER Grant #1555267</a>.

                        All tutorials demonstrate map design using the open access mapping software <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>. Thus, the objective of these tutorials is to enhance the cartographic design thinking described in Mapping for a Sustainable World with technical map software training, putting concepts into practice.

                            <i>Tambopata: Who Owns Paradise?</i>, is a map-centric, multimedia website created to enrich an educational role playing exercise about biodiversity, conservation, and development in the Amazon. The exercise assigns students a character from the Tambopata region of the Peruvian Amazon, and asks them to evaluate four proposed zoning plans from their assigned perspective. Using principles of web cartography, we designed the four proposal maps to communicate complex information and allow for increased exploration. Compared to the previously used static maps, the website increases opportunities for student engagement with the material, incorporates multimedia, and clarifies spatial relationships and land use patterns. The website is available publicly and can be integrated freely into other university and high school courses.

                            Flyover Country is a National Science Foundation funded offline mobile app for geoscience outreach and data discovery. The app exposes interactive geologic maps from Macrostrat.org, fossil localities from Neotomadb.org and Paleobiodb.org, core sample localities from LacCore.org, Wikipedia articles, offline base maps, and the userâ€™s current GPS determined location, altitude, speed, and heading. The app analyzes a given flight path and caches relevant map data and points of interest (POI), and displays these data during the flight, without in flight wifi. By downloading only the data relevant to a particular flightpath, cache sizes remain reasonable, allowing for a robust experience without an internet connection.
